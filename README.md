# Code-Quiz-Wk3
For this website I made a multiple choice code quiz on JavaScript.
When the user clicks the start button the quiz and timer begin.
If an answer is correct, there is a prompt for correct and if incorrect, time is deducted from the timer.
Last, when the quiz is finished the user can enter their initials.
